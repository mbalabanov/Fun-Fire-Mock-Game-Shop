        "long_description": "Marin was born in Bulgaria but is Viennese through and through, proudly embracing all advantages and disadvantages, Oida!<br>After years of working in IT in the pharmaceuticals industry, he decided to take time off work in his 40s and study at the Media Arts Histories program of the Danube University Krems, which he hopes to graduate as Master of Art in mid-2020. Marin lives in Sofia, Bulgaria, but spends a lot of time in Vienna. The city at the Danube draws him to it, like a siren that captured his heart, like a cosmic chain around his soul, like the beacon on the light tower of his fever dreams.<br>Marin is crazy about retro computers. His collection of old machines ranging from 1980 to 2020 encompasses forty odd pieces like the Macintosh SE/30 from 1991 and the Cambridge Z88 from 1987. His most cherished collector's item is the Tandy Radioshack TRS-80 Model 100 from 1984. He also loves everything to do with <strong>Star Wars</strong> and <strong>Marvel</strong>, which means he has basically sold his precious little life to Disney. When he is not watching and rewatching every single Star Wars and Marvel movie and TV show, he spends hours discussing even the most minor details of the two franchises. Yes, some say that this is not healthy. And of course Marin vehemently disagrees.<br>Marin is a participant of the Frontend Developer course at <em>Code Factory</em> and wants to be a developer when he grows up one day... if he ever manages to grow up.",

These words all describe aspects of my personality, of my journey as a young professional pursuing her degree. But there's only one word above all to singularly describe me, and everything i am: Entrepreneurial.<br>Entrepreneurial is my answer. The common misconception of entrepreneurship is that is only related to those starting their own business (which I will like to agree one day). However Entrepreneurship entails much more. It's the process of creating value through a unique combination of resources to exploit an opportunity.<br>Entrepreneurship is about risk taking. Not just going in blindly, but calculating risks. Learning as much as you can and ultimately acting upon opportunities that confront you.",

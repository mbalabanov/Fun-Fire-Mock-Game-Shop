		"review_text": "At first when I got it, I assumed everything was fine, but i quickly noticed that there were a couple things off about the controller. It might have been my paranoia, but I dont think these controllers are authentic. My right analog stick has stopped working within 4 months of me buying the controller. I had my original controller for years before it stopped working, and this one didn't even last half a year. I don't understand how that is possible. I bought one from Best Buy on Black Friday and compared, and there are minute details that are off with the touch pad and the directional pad. Additionally, the serial number label on the back of the controller is different than the other controllers I have (two I bought from Best Buy a couple days ago). I recommend buying from the store...these are not the wave!"

		"review_text": "First picture with blue Sony logo is a real authentic controller, off centered white logo is fake. Got the exact same controller from Walmart noticed . Fake is more closed in with plastic but authentic one has more open space with plastic casing. With authentic you can feel the difference it's a lot more quiet and not loud or clicky when you push TouchPad and l3/r3. Friends told me when I plugged my headset into the fake controller it would echo and sound terrible. Plugging headset into authentic one from Walmart there were no echoes and you were able to lower or increase volume sound unlike the fake one that stays the same no matter how you change the slider on ps4."

		"review_text": "For some reason these controllers from Amazon just aren't the same as the ones from wal-mart. They're lighter, the analog sticks are so loose, no stiffness at all, they just flop around, and they all die on me within a few months. There must be different manufacturers involved here."

		"review_text": "Bought this as a backup for my original PS4 controller which is still working just fine. Used lightly for about 30 hours of game play and the problem started. The left thumb stick does not appear to any longer be returning to center/neutral making it impossible to correctly interact with games as you are unwillingly moved in different directions and are unable to stay still. Resetting the controller did not correct the issue. Realize that I am out of the return window so I just bit the bullet and bought another $42 replacement. I don't think that it is unrealistic to expect the controller to work longer than it did. Very disappointed. Keeping my fingers crossed for the new one that just arrive."

		"review_text": "For the untrained eye let me teach you how to spot a real Dualshock 4 controller from a fake<br>1. Does your controller touch pad in the middle make a loud clicking sound uppon pressing down? If Yes then its a fake, original ps4 controllers have a smooth soft click when pushing down the touch pad<br>2. Original controllers always have an orangy yellowy light turning on and off when charging.. ALWAYS, unless its fully charge. If uppon chargung your controller the light turns orange or yellow then turns off and doesnt keep repeating the process but it is still charging while there is no light to indicate that the controller is charging then its definitely a fake. If you are not to sure, make sure there is only 0,1, or 2 bars left before charging because some controller wont charge if they are at 3 full bars and wont go down a bar untill an hour or 2 pass by depending on the vibration and button movement. To check battery status you can just press and hold the playstation button down.<br>3. And one of my favorites is when you turn on your controller keep an eyes on the light in back of your controller as it lids ups, should take a second or 2 to fully turn on. If it flickers when the light is turning on or the light lags or looks like it struggled to turn fully on, it is 100% fake. Easiest way to spot a counterfit."
